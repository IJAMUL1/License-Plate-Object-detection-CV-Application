# License Plate Detection with YOLOv5

This project uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to detect license plates in images or videos. It provides options to filter license plates by color (red or blue) and displays the results in real-time using OpenCV. when you run script, you will be required to pick a color (red or blue). This color will represent your opponent's color. This project draws a box around your opponents plate as a means of identification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/IJAMUL1/License-Plate-Object-detection-CV-Application.git

2. Download the YOLOv5 model and place them in the root directory.

## Note
you will have to upload your pre trained deep learning model to detect plates. This code will help identify only plates of specific colors (red or blue).

## Usage

Run the script named: plate_detection_code.py

## Expected Output

See video output to identify red license plates.
